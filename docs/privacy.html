      <p>Effective date: February 10, 2026</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Float Climbing ("we", "our", "the app") is operated by Rory Cosslett. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the Float Climbing mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Account Information</h3>
    <p>When you sign in using Google or Apple, we receive your name and email address from the authentication provider. We do not store your password — authentication is handled entirely by Google or Apple.</p>

    <h3>Profile Information</h3>
    <p>You may provide a display name, first name, last name, and profile photo. Your profile photo is stored in our cloud storage. You can control whether your profile is publicly visible to other users.</p>

    <h3>Climbing Data</h3>
    <p>The app collects the climbing data you log, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Climbing sessions (start time, end time, paused duration)</li>
      <li>Individual climbs (grade, type such as boulder/sport/trad, status such as send/attempt, timestamp)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Social Data</h3>
    <p>If you use social features, we store:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your follow relationships (who you follow and who follows you)</li>
      <li>Activity feed items generated when you complete sessions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preferences</h3>
    <p>We store your app preferences such as your chosen grading system (e.g. V-scale, Font scale, YDS, French).</p>

    <h3>Photo Library Access</h3>
    <p>The app may request access to your photo library for the purpose of selecting a profile picture or adding photos to your climbing sessions. We only access photos you explicitly choose.</p>

    <h3>Session Photos</h3>
    <p>You may optionally attach a photo to a climbing session. Session photos are stored in our cloud storage and may be visible to your followers if the session is set to public.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and operate the app's core features (logging climbs, tracking sessions, displaying analytics)</li>
      <li>To sync your data across devices</li>
      <li>To enable social features (activity feed, following other users)</li>
      <li>To display your profile to other users (if you have set your profile to public)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Store Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored using <strong>Supabase</strong>, a cloud-hosted database platform. We use row-level security policies to ensure that your data is isolated and only accessible by you, unless you have opted into social features (e.g. a public profile or activity feed).</p>
    <p>Profile photos and session photos are stored in dedicated cloud storage buckets with access controls that only allow you to upload, update, or delete your own media.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app uses the following third-party services that may process your data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Supabase</strong> — authentication, database, and file storage</li>
      <li><strong>Google</strong> — if you sign in with Google, your authentication is processed by Google's OAuth service</li>
      <li><strong>Apple</strong> — if you sign in with Apple, your authentication is processed by Apple's Sign In service</li>
      <li><strong>Expo (EAS)</strong> — used for delivering app updates; may collect basic device metadata</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.</p>
    <p>Your climbing activity may be visible to users who follow you if you use the app's social features. You can control your profile visibility in the app settings.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your data for as long as your account is active. You may request deletion of your account and all associated data at any time by contacting us.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access the personal data we hold about you</li>
      <li>Request correction of inaccurate data</li>
      <li>Request deletion of your account and data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the details below.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Float Climbing is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly delete it.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the effective date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
